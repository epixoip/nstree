# nstree

Displays information about network daemons in a convenient tree view. It's like pstree for netstat.

This has only ever been tested on Debian and Ubuntu. I hear it is broken on CentOS 6. I'm not a CentOS/RHEL user, so if you want to fix it and submit a pull request, be my guest.

### Usage
    ./nstree.pl
